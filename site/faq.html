      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <hr>
      <h4>What is MASLAB?</h4>
      <p>MASLAB is an MIT autonomous robotics competition during IAP.</p>

      <h4>When is MASLAB?</h4>
      <p>Please see the <a href="calendar.html">Calendar</a>.

      <h4>Who runs MASLAB?</h4>
      <p>MASLAB is run each year by a dedicated group of MIT undergraduate and graduate students. Please see <a href="about.html">About Us</a> for more information.</p>

      <h4>Who can compete in MASLAB?</h4>
      <p>Registration is open to all MIT students. Teams should have 3 or 4 members of undergraduate or graduate students. Students who have already participated in MASLAB in past years may participate again provided that at least half of each team consists of new members. No robots or equipment from previous MASLAB competitions may be used.</p>

      <h4>I don't have a team; what do I do?</h4>
      <p>Individuals may register for MASLAB. We will attempt to place you on a team if possible. Priority is given to fully formed teams.</p>

      <h4>I don't know anything about robots!; what do I do?</h4>
      <p>You don't need any experience! Just bring an active, interested, and learning mind. We will have a week of lectures about coding, mechanical design and robots in general. We also have plenty of documentation on our wiki. We do recommend that at least one team member have experience with programming.</p>

      <h4>What machine tools will I have access to?</h4>
      <p>The MASLAB lab will have a number of hand and power tools including drills, saws, screwdrivers, hammers and more. The staff will be able to laser cut and water jet any parts that you request. Each team will have the opportunity to attend basic training at the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/Edgerton/www/Shop.html" target="_blank">MIT Edgerton Student Shop</a>, granting access there. Students may also work in their locations, such as the <a href="http://studentlife.mit.edu/hobbyshop" target="_blank">MIT Hobby Shop</a>.</p>

      <h4>What coding languages or tools does MASLAB use?</h4>
      <p>MASLAB primarily uses Python on Linux and will prepare a number of MASLAB Python libraries for the 2013 competition. You are allowed to use any languages or tools which you choose, but MASLAB staff may not be able to assist in debugging or otherwise.</p>

      <h4>How much does MASLAB cost?</h4>
      <p>MASLAB is free! Really. There is a collateral check of $200 required per team to hold a spot in Maslab, which will be collected after the lottery. The check is only cashed if a team begins participating in MASLAB but drops out. This is to cover expenses per team, including the eeePC, Arduino, motors, etc. Note that after MASLAB, you can keep all of your materials.</p>

      <h4>My company is interested in sponsoring MASLAB; where can I learn more?</h4>
      <p>We are always happy to speak with potential sponsors! Send us an email at <a href="mailto:maslab-sponsors@mit.edu">maslab-sponsors@mit.edu</a> and see our <a href="sponsors.html">Sponsors</a> page for more information.</p>

      <h4>I have a question that isn't here!</h4>
      <p>For any other questions, please contact us at <a href="maslab@mit.edu">maslab@mit.edu</a></p>
