      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>In MASLAB matches, two autonomous robots compete head-to-head to earn points by capturing, manipulating and scoring balls. These robots must operate completely autonomously and score more points to win the match. Over IAP, you and your team will work to design, build and code the robot that will bring you to victory.

      <h3>MASLAB 2013 rules will appear shortly!</h3>
      <h4>Below are past rules, which are similar in spirit to the MASLAB 2013 rules.</h4>
      <hr>
      <h4>Basic Rules</h4>
      <p>The competition consists of 1v1 matches, autonomous robot versus autonomous robot. The field is split in half, with a robot on each side of the field. Each side of the field starts with one color of ball (green or red); the balls that start on a particular robot's side of the field are the only balls that that robot can score points with.</p>

      <p>The robots get points by putting their balls into (or near) goals on the ground level, or by lobbing balls over the wall separating them from the other robot. Robots get the most points for putting their balls over the wall, but they run the risk of getting their own balls collected by the other robot and returned to them.</p>

      <p>At the end of the match, scores are determined by counting the number of balls in goals, near goals, and on the opposite side of the wall from which they started. This means that if a ball is knocked away from a goal it was scored in, it earns that robot no points. Similarly, if a ball that was lobbed over the wall is returned, that ball earns the robot no points.</p>

      <h4>Basic Kit</h4>

      <p>The kit has consists of an Arduino, an eeePC, a webcam, 2 motor assemblies, a caster, and two 12V lead acid batteries. Servos, IR sensors, more motors, and other sensors and actuators may be requested from staff.</p>
