      <h4>1. Robot</h4>

      <p>Robots can have a footprint no larger than 14x14 inches. Height is not restricted, but keep in mind that your team is responsible for housing your robot outside of lab hours. Therefore you will be carrying your robot around (likely in your team tub) and an excessively tall robot will be hard to handle.</p>

      <p>Robots must not use any power sources except those provided by or approved by Maslab.</p>

      <p>Robots must be able to boot unattended and run your robot from a button press without network access.</p>

      <p>Robots may only use one camera (unless you are planning on using stereo vision, in which case you should discuss your plans with staff).</p>

      <p>Robots must not consume more than 50 sensor points. Sensor points can be deducted from your team for bad behavior, such as failure to clean up.</p>

      <a id="field" class="jump">&nbsp;</a>
      <h4>2. Field Specifications</h4>

      <p>All walls are 6 in high with a ~1 in blue strip along the top. </p>

      <p>The wall between the sides is yellow. You must score over the yellow section of the wall if scoring over the wall. </p>

      <p>The walls comprising the scoring box are brown, orange, and purple. All other walls are white. Balls will be red or green depending on which side. </p>

      <p>The scoring tower will be at least 16 inches from the yellow wall at its closest point.  The three scoring areas in the scoring tower will be 24 inches, 15 inches, and 6 inches square. The heights of these areas will be 6 inches, 10 inches, and 14 inches respectively.</p>

      <p>All corridors will be at least 16 inches wide.</p>

      <p>Walls will not meet at less than a 90 degree angle.</p>

      <a id="competition" class="jump">&nbsp;</a>
      <h4>3.  Competition Rules</h4>

      <p>Balls are green or red depending on side.  Each side starts with 8 balls per side.</p>

      <p>Four balls are released on each side each time any robot presses the green button.  Up to 16 balls can be released onto each side by pressing the green button.</p>

      <p>200 points are awarded for any robot that maintains a cleared field by the end of the three-minute play period.  This means you must clear all balls of both color through scoring or posession</p>

      <p>Scoring with opponentâ€™s color balls do not count toward your score</p>
